                    <p>The game RANDOMLY picks a numberbetween 0 and 99 that is known only to the Console.
                    The player then has a chance of making 10 guesses to unveil the mystery number.
                    Each time a guess is made, a message comes up to announce one of the following:<br>
                    a) That's lower! Guess: _ Remaining: _ (so player will know he/she must guess higher figure to get the mystery number)<br>
                    b) That's higher! Guess: _ Remaining: _ (similar to above, it to guide the player on what to guess next)<br>
                    c) No more guesses remaining! The number was _<br>
                    d) Yes, its _! It took you _ guesses<br>
                    Now you can start playing the game and I assure you that you will find it interesting. Enjoy!</p>
